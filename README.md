# TidyTree

## What?

TidyTree is yet another d3-powered Phylogenetic tree renderer.

## Shoutouts

tidytree is based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Andrew-Reid/c7ae41a98b8cbb38f1febf13deb9d294) ([See in action](https://bl.ocks.org/Andrew-Reid/c7ae41a98b8cbb38f1febf13deb9d294)), which "mostly just duplicates the cannonical[sic] d3.tree and d3.cluster bl.ocks by Mike Bostock."

## Why?

[MicrobeTrace](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace) needed a Phylogenetic Tree renderer that enabled rerooting and distance scaling. Additionally, there were a bunch of nice-to-haves, like Unrooted and Circular views, Zooming, Colorable and Selectable nodes... You get the idea. Of all the available phylogenetic tree libraries, [Phylotree](https://github.com/veg.phylotree.js) came closest, but it didn't quite cut it for us.
